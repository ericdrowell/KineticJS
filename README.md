## Mothballed
I will no longer be maintaining this repo or the official KineticJS website because I have moved onto other ventures and projects.  The latest version of KineticJS, 5.1.0, is very solid and can still be used in production applications.  Please feel free to fork the repo if you'd like to make changes.

## Concrete.js Alternative
Concrete.js is the lightweight version of KineticJS.  It supports perpherial things like hit detection, layering, pixel ratio management, exports, caching, and downloads.  While KineticJS is a heavy weight framework based on a scene graph, Concrete.js doesn't have an opinion on whether or not your canvas app requires a scene graph.  You can learn more by going to [www.concretejs.com](http://www.concretejs.com)

Also, you can now find tars of every stable KineticJS build on [www.kineticjs.com](http://www.kineticjs.com)

# Installation

* `bower install kineticjs`
* `npm install kinetic` - for Browserify. For nodejs you have to install some [dependencies](#NodeJS)

### NodeJS

Support of NodeJS is experimental.

We are using [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas) to create canvas element.

1. Install node-canvas [https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages)
2. `npm install jsdom`
3. `npm install kinetic`

See file `nodejs-demo.js` for example.

# Dev environment

Before doing all dev stuff make sure you have node installed. After that, run `npm install --dev` in the main directory to install the node module dependencies.

Run `grunt --help` to see all build options.

## Building the KineticJS Framework 

To build a development version of the framework, run `grunt dev`. To run a full build, which also produces the minified version and the individually minified modules for the custom build, run `grunt full`.  You can also run `grunt beta` to generate a beta version.   

If you add a file in the src directory, be sure to add the filename to the sourceFiles array variable in Gruntfile.js.

## Testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericdrowell/KineticJS.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ericdrowell/KineticJS)

KineticJS uses Mocha for testing. 

* If you need run test only one time run `grunt test`.
* While developing it is easy to use `grunt server` with watch task. Just run it and go to [http://localhost:8080/test/runner.html](http://localhost:8080/test/runner.html). After src file change kinetic-dev.js will be automatically created, so you just need refresh test the page.

KineticJS is covered with hundreds of tests and well over a thousand assertions.  KineticJS uses TDD (test driven development) which means that every new feature or bug fix is accompanied with at least one new test. 

## Generate documentation

Run `grunt docs` which will build the documentation files and place them in the docs folder.
